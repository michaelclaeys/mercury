# Mercury

> Prediction market infrastructure. Build and deploy automated trading bots for Polymarket, Kalshi, and event markets.

Mercury is a web-based platform that lets users build prediction market trading bots using a visual drag-and-drop node editor or an agentic AI that generates complete bots from natural language descriptions. Describe a strategy in plain English and the AI builds the full node graph — triggers, conditions, execution, and risk management — ready to deploy. It connects to Polymarket and Kalshi with sub-20ms execution latency. Users can paper trade for free, then deploy live when ready.
