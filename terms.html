          <p>By accessing or using Mercury ("the Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service, our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and our <a href="disclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a> (collectively, "the Agreement"). If you do not agree to every provision of this Agreement, do not access or use the Platform. Mercury reserves the right to modify these terms at any time; material changes will be communicated via email or platform notification at least 14 days before taking effect. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-heading">2. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater) to use the Platform. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and that you are not prohibited from using the Platform under applicable law.</p>
          <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of prediction markets, automated trading tools, and related services complies with all laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction. Mercury makes no representations regarding the legality of prediction market participation in any jurisdiction.</p>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-heading">3. Description of Service</h2>
          <p>Mercury provides analytics tools, data visualization, automated trading strategy building, and execution infrastructure for prediction markets. The Platform aggregates data from third-party prediction market platforms (including but not limited to Polymarket and Kalshi) and enables users to create, test, and deploy automated trading strategies.</p>
          <p>Mercury is a <strong>software platform providing tools and infrastructure</strong>. We are not a broker, dealer, exchange, custodian, investment advisor, or financial institution. We do not provide investment advice, trading recommendations, or financial guidance of any kind. No content on the Platform should be construed as such.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2 class="legal-heading">4. Account Registration</h2>
          <p>You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You must notify Mercury immediately of any unauthorized use. Mercury shall not be liable for any loss arising from unauthorized access to your account.</p>
          <p>Each individual may only maintain one account. Mercury reserves the right to refuse registration or terminate accounts at its sole discretion.</p>

          <p><strong>You acknowledge and agree that:</strong></p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li>Automated trading bots execute trades based on predefined conditions without human intervention and may result in rapid, significant losses</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for the configuration, testing, deployment, monitoring, and performance of any bots or strategies you create</li>
            <li>Past performance, backtesting results, and paper trading results do not guarantee future results and may not reflect actual market conditions</li>
            <li>Bot execution depends on market conditions, third-party API availability, network connectivity, and system uptime — none of which are guaranteed</li>
            <li>Mercury is not responsible for any losses, missed trades, erroneous executions, or other adverse outcomes resulting from bot operation, malfunction, misconfiguration, API failures, data inaccuracies, or any other cause</li>
            <li>You should never deploy trading capital you cannot afford to lose entirely</li>

          <p>Mercury may facilitate the creation of non-custodial wallets through third-party hardware security module (HSM) providers. Mercury does not hold, control, or have access to your private keys or funds. You are solely responsible for securing access to your wallet and any assets held within it.</p>
          <p>Mercury shall not be liable for any loss of funds, unauthorized transactions, or inability to access wallets resulting from third-party service disruptions, key management issues, blockchain network failures, or smart contract vulnerabilities.</p>

            <li><strong>Technology risk:</strong> Software may contain bugs, experience downtime, or fail to execute as expected. No software system is infallible</li>
            <li><strong>Third-party risk:</strong> Prediction market platforms, data providers, wallet services, and blockchain networks may experience failures, security breaches, or policy changes outside Mercury's control</li>
            <li><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Laws governing prediction markets, cryptocurrencies, and automated trading may change, potentially affecting your ability to use certain features or access certain markets</li>
