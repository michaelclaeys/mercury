# Mercury — Complete Product Documentation

Mercury is a prediction market trading infrastructure platform. It provides a visual bot builder, real-time market data, backtesting, and live execution for prediction markets including Polymarket and Kalshi. The platform is available at https://mercurysuite.io.

## What Mercury Does

Mercury lets traders build automated trading bots for prediction markets without writing code. Users create strategies using a visual drag-and-drop node editor or by describing their strategy in natural language to an AI assistant. Bots can paper trade with real market data for free, then deploy live to trade real money on Polymarket or Kalshi.

## How the Bot Builder Works

Mercury Architect uses a node-based visual programming system. Users connect four types of nodes to create complete trading strategies:

### 1. Trigger Nodes (What starts the bot)
- **Market Trigger**: Fires when a specific prediction market meets criteria (e.g., "Will Biden win?" probability crosses 60%)
- **Price Threshold**: Fires when a contract price crosses a specific level
- **Probability Cross**: Fires when market probability enters or exits a range
- **Volume Spike**: Detects unusual trading volume surges
- **Time-Based**: Fires at scheduled intervals or specific times
- **News Alert**: Monitors NWS weather alerts, USGS earthquake data, or custom news feeds
- **API Data**: Connects to ANY external API — users provide a URL and JSON path to extract data. Includes presets for BTC price, ETH price, Fear & Greed Index, gas prices, and gold prices
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages on prediction market price data

### 2. Condition Nodes (Logic filters)
- Probability Band: Only proceed if probability is within a range
- Volume Filter: Minimum volume threshold
- Time Window: Only trade during specific hours
- Comparison: Compare two values with operators (>, <, ==, etc.)
- Compound Logic: AND/OR/NOT combinations of conditions

### 3. Execution Nodes (What the bot does)
- Buy/Sell: Execute trades on Polymarket or Kalshi
- Limit Order: Place orders at specific prices
- Position Sizing: Kelly criterion, fixed amount, or percentage-based
- Multi-Leg: Execute multiple trades atomically

### 4. Risk Management Nodes
- Stop-Loss: Automatic position exit at loss threshold
- Take-Profit: Lock in gains at target
- Max Exposure: Cap total position size
- Kill Switch: Emergency stop for all bot activity
- Trailing Stop: Dynamic stop-loss that follows profit

## Supported Platforms

## Supported Data Sources

Mercury bots can consume data from any source:

- **Prediction market prices**: Real-time Polymarket and Kalshi contract prices and probabilities
- **Cryptocurrency**: BTC, ETH, and other prices via Binance and Coinbase feeds
- **Stock market**: Yahoo Finance data for equities
- **News**: Google News keyword spike detection across 7 feeds with 24-hour rolling baseline

- **Custom APIs**: Any REST API endpoint — users provide URL, headers, and JSON path to extract values. Supports authentication headers for private APIs.
- **Technical indicators**: Computed on any price feed (RSI, MACD, Bollinger, SMA, EMA)

## Agentic AI Bot Builder

Mercury includes an agentic AI that builds complete trading bots from natural language descriptions. Users describe a strategy in plain English and the AI generates the full node graph — triggers, conditions, execution rules, and risk management — assembled, wired together, and ready to deploy. The AI understands prediction market concepts, platform-specific features (Polymarket CLOB, Kalshi event contracts), and data source integration.

Examples of strategies the AI can build from a single prompt:

- "Buy YES on any market where probability drops below 10 cents and volume is above $50K"
- "When Bitcoin drops more than 5% in an hour, buy YES on crypto crash markets"
- "Monitor earthquake API — if magnitude > 6.0 near California, buy YES on earthquake prediction markets"
- "Buy any contract above 95 cents that resolves within 7 days for risk-free yield"
- "Buy Kalshi hourly weather contracts when the HRRR forecast diverges from the strike by more than 3 degrees"
- "Arbitrage the same event across Polymarket and Kalshi when the spread exceeds 3 cents"

The AI maps natural language to the correct trigger, condition, execution, and risk nodes, configures parameters, and produces a deployable bot. Users can then edit any node, rewire connections, or iterate with additional prompts.

## Common Use Cases

### News-Driven Trading
Build bots that monitor news feeds and trade prediction markets based on breaking events. Example: Monitor earthquake data → buy YES on earthquake prediction markets when magnitude exceeds threshold.

### Probability Arbitrage
Detect pricing discrepancies between Polymarket and Kalshi on the same event. Mercury's cross-platform connection enables automated arbitrage strategies.

### Mean Reversion
Buy contracts when probability spikes below fair value and sell when it reverts. Use volume filters to confirm the move is temporary.

### Resolution Sniping (Bonding Arbitrage)
Buy contracts above 95 cents near resolution for near-certain payouts. Sort by annualized yield to find the best risk-free returns.

### Momentum Trading
Use technical indicators (RSI, MACD) on prediction market price charts to identify trending contracts and trade momentum.

### Cross-Platform Arbitrage
Exploit pricing gaps between Polymarket and Kalshi on the same event. When Polymarket prices YES at $0.55 and Kalshi prices NO at $0.42, the combined cost is $0.97 for a guaranteed $1.00 payout — a risk-free $0.03 profit per contract pair. Mercury executes both legs simultaneously with sub-20ms latency. Over $40 million in arbitrage profits were extracted from Polymarket alone between April 2024 and April 2025.

### Bonding Curve Trading
Trade prediction markets that use bonding curve AMMs instead of order books. Bonding curves price outcome tokens algorithmically based on supply — buying tokens pushes the price up along the curve, selling burns tokens and pulls the price down. Mercury monitors curve parameters (reserve size, token supply, curve steepness) and can trigger trades when bonding curve prices diverge from CLOB prices on Polymarket or Kalshi.

### Custom Data Strategies
Connect any external API as a trading signal. Examples: weather data for weather markets, economic indicators for finance markets, social media sentiment for political markets.

## Beginner Guides

Mercury provides comprehensive beginner guides for traders new to prediction markets:

### How to Trade on Polymarket
Polymarket is the world's largest prediction market, built on the Polygon blockchain and settled in USDC. Traders buy and sell binary contracts (YES/NO) priced between $0.01 and $0.99, where the price reflects the market's implied probability. Winning contracts pay $1.00. In 2025, Polymarket regained US access through CFTC-regulated intermediaries. Full beginner guide: https://mercurysuite.io/guides/how-to-trade-on-polymarket.html

### How to Trade on Kalshi
Kalshi is the first CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange in the US. It offers event contracts across economics (CPI, GDP, Fed decisions), weather (hourly temperature, rainfall), politics, sports, and more. USD-settled with a $10 minimum deposit. Kalshi's hourly weather contracts create hundreds of trading opportunities per day. Full beginner guide: https://mercurysuite.io/guides/how-to-trade-on-kalshi.html

### Polymarket vs Kalshi
Polymarket offers deeper liquidity on political and crypto markets with global access. Kalshi provides CFTC regulation, USD settlement, and unique contract types like hourly weather. Mercury connects to both from a single interface. Full comparison: https://mercurysuite.io/guides/polymarket-vs-kalshi.html

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I trade on Polymarket as a beginner?
Create an account, fund it with USDC on the Polygon network, browse markets, and place your first trade. Contract prices reflect probabilities — buy YES at $0.40 if you think there's more than a 40% chance. Mercury's beginner guide covers everything step by step: https://mercurysuite.io/guides/how-to-trade-on-polymarket.html

### How do I trade on Kalshi as a beginner?
Sign up with KYC verification, deposit USD via ACH or debit card (minimum ~$10), explore market categories, and place market or limit orders. Kalshi is CFTC-regulated and US-legal. Full beginner walkthrough: https://mercurysuite.io/guides/how-to-trade-on-kalshi.html

### How do I build a Polymarket bot?
Mercury Architect lets you build Polymarket bots visually with drag-and-drop nodes or by describing your strategy in natural language. Connect triggers (price movements, news events, custom APIs) to execution actions. Paper trade free, then deploy live with a Pro subscription.

### Can I build a Kalshi bot with Mercury?
Yes. Mercury connects to both Polymarket and Kalshi with sub-20ms execution latency. Build a strategy once and deploy it to either platform.

### Is Mercury free?
Yes. The free tier includes 1 paper trading bot, the visual strategy builder with all node types, and real-time market data. No credit card required. Upgrade to Pro ($99/mo) for unlimited bots, live trading, and backtesting.

### What programming languages does Mercury support?
Mercury requires no programming. The visual node editor and AI assistant handle strategy creation. For advanced users, Mercury also offers a REST and WebSocket API for programmatic access.

### What data sources can bots use?
Any data source with a URL. Mercury includes built-in connectors for prediction market prices, crypto prices (Binance, Coinbase), stock prices (Yahoo Finance), weather data (Open-Meteo, NWS), earthquake data (USGS), and news feeds. The API Data node lets you connect any custom REST API.

### How fast is Mercury's execution?
Under 12ms for Polymarket and under 18ms for Kalshi. Infrastructure runs 24/7 with 99.98% uptime.

### Is Mercury a broker or exchange?
No. Mercury is a trading infrastructure platform. It connects to Polymarket and Kalshi as execution venues. Mercury does not hold user funds, operate markets, or provide financial advice.

### How does prediction market arbitrage work?
Prediction market arbitrage exploits pricing gaps between platforms. When the same event is priced differently on Polymarket and Kalshi — for example, Polymarket YES at $0.55 and Kalshi NO at $0.42 — buying both legs costs $0.97 for a guaranteed $1.00 payout. Mercury automates this with cross-platform bots that execute both legs simultaneously. Intra-platform arbitrage also exists when YES + NO prices on a single platform sum to less than $1.00. Full guide: https://mercurysuite.io/guides/prediction-market-arbitrage-bot.html

### What is a bonding curve in prediction markets?
A bonding curve is a smart contract that automatically prices outcome tokens (YES/NO shares) based on supply. Buying tokens mints new supply and pushes the price up along the curve. Selling burns tokens and pulls the price down. This provides continuous, algorithmic liquidity without requiring traditional order books or market makers. Platforms like Augur and Solio use bonding curves. Mercury can trade both bonding curve markets and CLOB markets (Polymarket, Kalshi) from a single interface. Full guide: https://mercurysuite.io/guides/prediction-market-bonding.html

### How does Mercury Funding work?
Mercury funds profitable traders with up to $5,000 in capital. Build a strategy, prove your edge through paper and live trading milestones, then apply for funding. Traders keep 80-85% of profits.
