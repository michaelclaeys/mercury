          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">What is Polymarket and why automate it?</h2>
          <p>Polymarket is the largest decentralized prediction market, allowing traders to buy and sell shares on the outcomes of real-world events — elections, economic data, geopolitical developments, sports, weather, and more. Each contract resolves to either $1 (if the event happens) or $0 (if it doesn't), and the current price reflects the market's implied probability of the outcome. (New to Polymarket? Start with our <a href="how-to-trade-on-polymarket.html">beginner's guide to trading on Polymarket</a>.)</p>
          <p>The opportunity in prediction markets is enormous, but the challenge is speed. Markets move in seconds when news breaks. A Federal Reserve statement, a court ruling, or a hurricane track update can shift probabilities by 20 or 30 cents before most traders even open their browser. Manual trading means you are always reacting. Automated trading means you are already positioned.</p>
          <p>A Polymarket trading bot eliminates three critical weaknesses of human traders. First, speed: bots execute in milliseconds, not minutes. Second, availability: bots run 24/7 without sleep, vacations, or distractions. Third, discipline: bots follow rules without emotion, fear, or greed. They do not revenge-trade after a loss or hesitate on a signal they have already validated.</p>
          <p>Building a Polymarket bot used to require weeks of Python development, a rented VPS, custom API integrations, and constant maintenance. <a href="../architect.html">Mercury Architect</a> eliminates all of that. You design a strategy visually with drag-and-drop nodes, or describe it in plain English and let Mercury's agentic AI build the entire node graph for you — triggers, conditions, execution rules, and risk management, assembled automatically from a single sentence. Mercury handles the infrastructure, execution, and monitoring. This guide walks through every step.</p>

  <!-- ─── STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE ────────────────────────────── -->
  <section class="page-section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="page-prose">

        <div class="page-prose-block">
          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">Step 1: How do I choose a trigger for my Polymarket bot?</h2>
          <p>Every automated Polymarket strategy starts with a trigger — the event or data signal that tells your bot to evaluate a trade. Mercury Architect provides 4 node types for building strategies, and the Trigger node is where every bot begins.</p>
          <p>You have several trigger categories to choose from:</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Market event triggers</strong> — fire when a specific Polymarket contract reaches a price threshold, crosses a probability level, or experiences a volume spike. Example: "When the 'Fed Rate Cut June' contract drops below 30 cents."</li>
            <li><strong>Price threshold triggers</strong> — monitor any asset or contract and fire when a price crosses above or below a value you define. Works for Polymarket contracts, cryptocurrency prices, or any numeric data source.</li>
            <li><strong>News and sentiment triggers</strong> — monitor real-time news feeds, social media sentiment, or headline keywords. Example: "When a major outlet publishes a headline containing 'indictment' and the sentiment score exceeds 0.8."</li>
            <li><strong>Custom API triggers</strong> — connect any external data source via URL. Mercury polls your endpoint at configurable intervals and fires when conditions are met. Use this for proprietary models, internal datasets, or any source not already built in.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the <a href="../architect.html">Architect visual builder</a>, drag a Trigger node onto the canvas and configure the source, threshold, and polling interval. Each trigger can feed into one or many downstream Condition nodes. Or skip the manual setup entirely — tell Mercury's AI something like "trigger when any Polymarket contract drops below 20 cents with volume above $50K" and the AI agent builds the trigger node, configures the parameters, and wires it into your strategy automatically.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-prose-block">
          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">Step 2: How do I add conditions to filter my bot's trades?</h2>
          <p>Conditions are the logic layer between your trigger and your execution. They prevent your bot from trading on noise by requiring multiple signals to align before an order is placed.</p>
          <p>Common condition configurations for Polymarket bots:</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Probability band filter</strong> — only trade when the contract price is within a defined range. Example: "Only buy if YES is between 20c and 45c." This keeps your bot out of markets where the edge is already priced in.</li>
            <li><strong>Volume filter</strong> — require minimum trading volume in the last N hours before entering. Low-volume contracts have wide spreads and poor fill rates. A volume floor protects your execution quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Time window</strong> — restrict trading to specific hours, days, or date ranges. Some strategies only work during US market hours, or within the final week before contract resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-source confirmation</strong> — require two or more independent data sources to agree. Example: "Trigger fires on news headline AND Polymarket price is still below 40c AND Twitter sentiment is bullish." This AND/OR logic is built into the Condition node with unlimited chaining.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Connect your Trigger node output to the Condition node input. You can chain multiple Condition nodes in series for complex logic, or use parallel branches for different execution paths based on different market states.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-prose-block">
          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">Step 3: How do I set execution rules for my Polymarket bot?</h2>
          <p>The Execution node defines what your bot does when the trigger fires and all conditions are met. This is where your strategy becomes a trade.</p>
          <p>Mercury supports the following execution configurations:</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Direction</strong> — buy YES shares (betting the event happens) or buy NO shares (betting it doesn't). You can also configure your bot to sell existing positions when exit conditions are met.</li>
            <li><strong>Order type</strong> — market orders for immediate fills, or limit orders at a specific price. Limit orders protect against slippage in fast-moving markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Position sizing with Kelly criterion</strong> — the Kelly criterion calculates optimal bet size based on your estimated edge and the odds. Mercury implements Kelly sizing natively in the Execution node. Set your estimated probability and the node calculates the mathematically optimal position size. You can also use half-Kelly for more conservative sizing.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed amount sizing</strong> — deploy a flat dollar amount per trade regardless of edge estimation. Simpler, more predictable, and easier to manage when running multiple bots.</li>
            <li><strong>Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</strong> — split a large position into smaller orders executed over time. Reduces impact cost and averages your entry price across market fluctuations.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-platform execution</strong> — execute the same strategy across Polymarket and Kalshi simultaneously. Mercury routes orders to both exchanges with low-latency connections.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each Execution node connects downstream to a Risk node, ensuring every trade has protective guardrails before it reaches the market.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-prose-block">
          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">Step 4: How do I manage risk on an automated Polymarket bot?</h2>
          <p>Risk management is the difference between a profitable bot and an account blowup. Mercury Architect makes risk controls a required part of every strategy, not an afterthought.</p>
          <p>Every bot should include the following risk parameters:</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Stop-loss</strong> — automatically exit a position if the contract moves against you by a defined amount. Example: "Sell all YES shares if the price drops 15c below my average entry." This limits your maximum loss per trade to a known amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Take-profit</strong> — lock in gains when a contract reaches your target. Example: "Sell 50% of my position at 70c and the remaining 50% at 85c." Partial take-profits let you capture gains while leaving upside exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum exposure</strong> — cap the total dollar amount your bot can deploy across all open positions. This prevents a single runaway strategy from consuming your entire bankroll.</li>
            <li><strong>Kill switch</strong> — an emergency control that instantly closes all positions and halts all bot activity. Accessible from the Mercury dashboard, from Telegram, or configured to trigger automatically based on portfolio-level drawdown thresholds. Example: "Kill all bots if total portfolio drawdown exceeds 20%."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mercury's risk engine runs independently of the strategy engine. Even if your trigger logic has a bug, the risk layer will still enforce stop-losses, exposure limits, and kill-switch conditions. It monitors 24/7 on infrastructure with 99.98% uptime.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-prose-block">
          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">Step 5: How do I test my Polymarket bot before going live?</h2>
          <p>Mercury includes full paper trading — simulated execution against real-time Polymarket order book data. Your bot runs exactly as it would in production, placing orders, tracking P&L, and logging every decision, but no real money is at risk.</p>
          <p>Paper trading validates three things:</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Logic correctness</strong> — does the bot trigger when expected? Do the conditions filter correctly? Are the execution rules producing the right order types and sizes?</li>
            <li><strong>Performance metrics</strong> — track win rate, net P&L, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and Brier score over time. These numbers tell you whether the strategy has genuine edge or is curve-fitted to recent data.</li>
            <li><strong>Edge cases</strong> — what happens when the market gaps overnight? When volume dries up? When two triggers fire simultaneously? Paper trading exposes these scenarios before they cost you real capital.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Every Mercury account also includes the full backtesting engine, which replays your strategy against historical Polymarket data. Backtest results include equity curves, trade-by-trade breakdowns, and statistical significance tests. Between paper trading and backtesting, you can validate a strategy thoroughly before deploying a single dollar.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page-prose-block">
          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">Step 6: How do I deploy my Polymarket bot to live trading?</h2>
          <p>Deployment on Mercury takes under 30 seconds. Whether you built your bot visually or had the AI agent generate it from a natural language description, one click validates your node graph, runs a final backtest against recent data, connects to the Polymarket API, provisions a Telegram alerting bot, and pushes your strategy to production.</p>
          <p>Here is what Mercury handles at deploy time:</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Infrastructure provisioning</strong> — your bot runs on Mercury's production servers. No VPS to rent, no Docker to configure, no uptime to monitor. Mercury's infrastructure runs 24/7 with 99.98% uptime and low-latency execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Telegram integration</strong> — every deployed bot gets automatic Telegram alerts for trade executions, P&L updates, risk events, and kill-switch activations. You can also send manual override commands from Telegram.</li>
            <li><strong>Live monitoring</strong> — the Mercury dashboard shows real-time status for every running bot: open positions, recent trades, cumulative P&L, and current risk exposure. All data updates in real time.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot parameter updates</strong> — change position sizes, risk limits, trigger thresholds, or conditions on a running bot without stopping execution. The changes apply to the next evaluation cycle.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Live trading is free for all Mercury users — unlimited bots, unlimited backtesting, and priority support included. There are no per-trade fees, no server costs, no subscriptions, and no hidden charges.</p>

          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">What data sources work with Polymarket bots?</h2>
          <p>Mercury bots can ingest any data source with a URL. The platform includes built-in connectors for the most common prediction market signals, and the API Data node lets you add any custom source.</p>
          <p>Built-in data sources:</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Prediction market prices</strong> — real-time price, volume, and order book data from Polymarket and Kalshi. Stream probability changes as they happen.</li>
            <li><strong>Cryptocurrency prices</strong> — live feeds from Binance, Coinbase, and other major exchanges. Useful for crypto-correlated prediction markets or as hedging signals.</li>
            <li><strong>News headlines and sentiment</strong> — aggregated news feeds with natural language processing for keyword matching, entity extraction, and sentiment scoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Weather data</strong> — real-time and forecast data from Open-Meteo, NOAA, and the National Weather Service. Critical for hurricane, temperature, and climate-related markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Earthquake and seismic data</strong> — live USGS feeds for magnitude, location, and depth. Triggers for earthquake prediction markets can fire within seconds of an event.</li>
            <li><strong>Polling and survey data</strong> — election polling aggregators, approval ratings, and economic sentiment surveys. Essential for political prediction markets.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom API endpoints</strong> — any REST API you can reach. Point the API Data node at a URL, define the JSON path to your signal, and Mercury will poll it at the interval you configure. Use this for proprietary models, internal research, or niche data sources.</li>
          </ul>

  <!-- ─── COMMON STRATEGIES ─────────────────────────────── -->
  <section class="page-section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="page-prose">
        <div class="page-prose-block">
          <h2 class="page-prose-heading">What are the most common Polymarket bot strategies?</h2>
          <p>Most profitable Polymarket bots fall into one of four categories. Each can be built entirely within Mercury Architect — either by assembling nodes visually or by describing the strategy in plain English and letting Mercury's agentic AI generate the complete bot for you.</p>
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li><strong>Mean reversion</strong> — buy when a contract is underpriced relative to its historical average or fundamental value, and sell when it reverts. Works best in liquid markets with clear anchoring signals (e.g., polling averages for election markets). Set a Trigger node on price deviation from your model, a Condition node requiring sufficient volume, and an Execution node with Kelly sizing.</li>
            <li><strong>News-driven (event arbitrage)</strong> — react to breaking news faster than the market. This strategy monitors news feeds, social media, and official data releases, then trades before other participants can update their positions. Speed is everything here. Mercury's low-latency execution and real-time news ingestion give you a structural advantage over manual traders. For cross-platform approaches, see our <a href="prediction-market-arbitrage-bot.html">arbitrage bot guide</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution sniping</strong> — trade contracts in the final hours or days before resolution, when the outcome is highly probable but the contract has not fully priced it in. Example: a contract on "Will the unemployment rate exceed 4%?" trading at 82c when the BLS report is 30 minutes away and every leading indicator confirms YES. The edge is in identifying near-certain outcomes that the market still prices below 95c.</li>
            <li><strong>Momentum</strong> — follow rapid price movements in a single direction. When a contract starts moving sharply (often driven by a catalyst that has not yet been fully absorbed), momentum bots ride the trend and exit before mean reversion kicks in. Use volume and velocity triggers to identify genuine momentum versus random noise.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Mercury's backtesting engine lets you compare these strategy types against historical data before committing capital. Many traders run multiple bots simultaneously — a mean reversion strategy on liquid political markets, a news-driven bot on high-volatility events, and a resolution sniper for the final days of expiring contracts.</p>
          <p>Traders who prove consistent profitability can also apply for <a href="../funding.html">Mercury Funding</a>, where Mercury deposits up to $5,000 of capital into your account and you keep 80-85% of the profits.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">Under 30 seconds. Once your strategy is built in the visual editor or generated by AI, one click validates, backtests, and deploys it to Mercury's production infrastructure. Execution latency to Polymarket is low.</div>

          <summary class="faq-question">Can I test my bot before risking real money?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">Yes. Every Mercury account includes free paper trading with real-time Polymarket data. Your bot executes simulated trades against live order books so you can validate performance — P&L, win rate, drawdown, Sharpe ratio — before committing capital. Full backtesting against historical data is also included for free.</div>
