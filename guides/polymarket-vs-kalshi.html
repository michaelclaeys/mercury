        <p>If you are choosing between Polymarket and Kalshi, you are asking the right question. These are the two dominant prediction market platforms in 2026, and they serve different types of traders. Polymarket is the decentralized, crypto-native exchange with global reach and deep liquidity on political markets. Kalshi is the CFTC-regulated US exchange with unique short-term contracts and traditional settlement. This guide breaks down every meaningful difference so you can decide which platform — or both — fits your trading approach.</p>

        <!-- ─── PLATFORM OVERVIEWS ──────────────────────── -->
        <h2>What is Polymarket?</h2>

        <p>Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market built on the Polygon blockchain. It uses a central limit order book (CLOB) model and settles all trades in USDC, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. Polymarket is accessible globally — there is no geographic restriction enforced at the protocol level, though US-based traders face regulatory limitations following a 2022 CFTC settlement.</p>

        <p>The platform has established itself as the highest-volume prediction market in the world. During major political events, Polymarket regularly processes tens of millions of dollars in daily volume. Its market categories span politics, sports, crypto, entertainment, and science. The order book model means traders can place limit orders, and sophisticated participants frequently provide liquidity for profit. Polymarket's open API and blockchain-based architecture make it a natural fit for algorithmic and bot-driven strategies. For a deeper look, see our <a href="polymarket-guide.html">complete Polymarket trading guide</a>.</p>

        <h2>What is Kalshi?</h2>

        <p>Kalshi is a US-based prediction market exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It is the first federally regulated exchange dedicated to event contracts in the United States. Kalshi settles in USD, requires KYC verification, and is available exclusively to US residents and citizens.</p>

        <p>Kalshi's market structure focuses on event contracts — binary and bounded outcomes tied to real-world events. What makes Kalshi distinctive is its short-term contract offering: hourly weather contracts, daily economic indicator predictions, and rapid-expiry event markets that no other platform provides. These high-frequency contract types create opportunities for systematic, data-driven strategies that can execute dozens of trades per day. Kalshi also offers markets on politics, finance, and cultural events. For platform-specific details, see our <a href="kalshi-guide.html">complete Kalshi trading guide</a>.</p>

        <!-- ─── BOT TRADING ─────────────────────────────── -->
        <h2>Which platform is better for bot trading?</h2>

        <p>Both Polymarket and Kalshi are viable platforms for automated trading, but they reward different strategies. The best choice depends on what you are building.</p>

        <h3>Polymarket for bot trading</h3>

        <p>Polymarket's strengths for algorithmic traders center on liquidity and volume. Political markets on Polymarket regularly see $5M+ in daily volume on major events, which means tighter spreads and faster fills for market-making bots. The CLOB order book model is familiar to anyone coming from crypto or traditional equities. Settlement is on-chain, which adds transparency but introduces gas costs as a variable. Polymarket's API delivers real-time order book data via WebSocket, and Mercury connects to it with sub-12ms execution latency.</p>

        <h3>Kalshi for bot trading</h3>

        <p>Kalshi's edge for automated strategies is its unique contract structure. Hourly weather contracts — Will the temperature in Chicago exceed 85 degrees between 2pm and 3pm? — create dozens of trading opportunities per day with outcomes driven by measurable, predictable data feeds. Economic indicator contracts (CPI, jobs reports, GDP) reward traders who can integrate real-time data faster than the market. These short-duration contracts are ideal for high-frequency strategies that capitalize on rapid mean reversion and data-driven edge. Mercury connects to Kalshi with sub-18ms execution latency, fast enough for most systematic approaches.</p>

        <h3>The verdict</h3>

        <p>If your strategy focuses on political or crypto event markets with high volume, Polymarket is the stronger venue. If you are building systematic strategies around weather data, economic indicators, or high-frequency short-term contracts, Kalshi offers opportunities that simply do not exist elsewhere. Many serious traders use both. Mercury supports both platforms from a single interface, so you do not have to choose — you can build one strategy and deploy it to either exchange.</p>

        <!-- ─── CROSS-PLATFORM ──────────────────────────── -->
        <h2>Can you trade on both Polymarket and Kalshi?</h2>

        <p>Yes. There is no restriction on maintaining accounts on both platforms simultaneously (subject to each platform's eligibility requirements). In fact, trading both platforms creates a significant structural advantage: cross-platform arbitrage.</p>

        <p>When the same event is listed on both Polymarket and Kalshi — which happens frequently with major political and economic events — the prices are not always identical. A 2-4 cent difference on a binary contract represents a risk-free profit opportunity if you can execute on both sides fast enough. Mercury's cross-platform research dashboard tracks these price discrepancies in real time and flags arbitrage windows as they appear. Over a 90-day tracking period, we observed consistent arbitrage opportunities averaging 2-4 cents on high-volume contracts, with some windows exceeding 6 cents during periods of high volatility.</p>

        <p>Beyond arbitrage, running strategies on both platforms gives you access to a combined market catalog that no single platform can match: Polymarket's deep political and crypto markets plus Kalshi's hourly weather and economic contracts. This diversification reduces your dependence on any single event category.</p>

        <!-- ─── MERCURY INTEGRATION ─────────────────────── -->
        <h2>How does Mercury work with both platforms?</h2>

        <p><a href="../architect.html">Mercury Architect</a> is the only trading infrastructure that connects to both Polymarket and Kalshi through a single interface. Instead of switching between browser tabs, managing separate API keys in different scripts, and manually comparing prices, Architect gives you one unified view of both platforms.</p>

        <p>Mercury also includes an agentic AI that builds complete trading strategies from natural language. Describe what you want — "Monitor both platforms for arbitrage opportunities on the same event, buy the cheaper side when the spread exceeds 3 cents, and close when it converges" — and the AI generates the full node graph with cross-platform triggers, condition filters, execution rules, and risk management. No coding, no manual node assembly.</p>

        <p>Here is what that looks like in practice:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI-powered strategy generation:</strong> Describe any strategy in plain English. The agentic AI builds the complete bot — triggers, conditions, execution, and risk nodes — wired together and ready to deploy.</li>
          <li><strong>Unified order routing:</strong> Place orders on either platform from the same terminal. Architect handles authentication, order formatting, and execution for both APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform price monitoring:</strong> See Polymarket and Kalshi prices for the same event side by side. Arbitrage opportunities are flagged automatically.</li>
          <li><strong>Sub-12ms Polymarket execution:</strong> Direct connection to Polymarket's CLOB with optimized order routing.</li>
          <li><strong>Sub-18ms Kalshi execution:</strong> Low-latency connection to Kalshi's exchange with full order type support.</li>
          <li><strong>Strategy portability:</strong> Build a bot strategy once and deploy it to either platform — or both simultaneously. No code changes required between venues.</li>
          <li><strong>Real-time analytics:</strong> Probability tracking, volume analysis, and <a href="../architect-app.html#charting">candlestick charting</a> across both platforms in a single dashboard.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you are running a simple market-making bot, a data-driven weather strategy on Kalshi, or cross-platform arbitrage across both exchanges, Architect provides the execution layer. You focus on strategy; Mercury handles the infrastructure. <a href="../signup.html">Get started free</a> or <a href="../architect.html#pricing">view pricing</a>.</p>

        <!-- ─── KEY DIFFERENCES ─────────────────────────── -->
        <h2>What are the key differences for serious traders?</h2>

        <p>Beyond the feature comparison table, there are several nuanced differences that matter when you are deploying real capital.</p>

        <p><strong>Regulatory risk.</strong> Kalshi's CFTC regulation provides clear legal standing in the US. Your funds are held in segregated accounts, and the exchange operates under federal oversight. Polymarket operates in a more ambiguous regulatory environment — the 2022 CFTC settlement resulted in US access restrictions, and the long-term regulatory trajectory remains uncertain. For US-based traders managing significant capital, Kalshi's regulatory clarity is a meaningful advantage.</p>

        <p><strong>Settlement speed.</strong> Polymarket settles on-chain, which means outcomes resolve as soon as the oracle confirms the result — typically within minutes. Kalshi settles through traditional financial rails, which can take longer but avoids any blockchain-related friction. For strategies that depend on rapid capital recycling between events, settlement speed matters.</p>

        <p><strong>Market depth patterns.</strong> Polymarket's liquidity concentrates heavily on headline political markets. A presidential election contract might have $50M+ in open interest, while a niche entertainment market might have $50K. Kalshi's liquidity is more evenly distributed across its contract types, with weather and economic contracts maintaining consistent depth because they resolve frequently and attract systematic traders.</p>

        <p><strong>Data availability.</strong> Both platforms provide real-time market data through their APIs. However, Kalshi's short-term contracts (hourly weather, daily economic events) naturally generate more data points per unit of time, which means you can backtest and validate strategies faster. A weather bot on Kalshi can collect hundreds of resolved contract outcomes per month. A political strategy on Polymarket might only see a handful of major resolutions per quarter.</p>

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Is Polymarket or Kalshi better for beginners?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Kalshi is generally the easier starting point for beginners. It accepts USD deposits as low as $1, requires no cryptocurrency knowledge, and operates under CFTC regulation — which provides a familiar, traditional-finance experience. Polymarket requires setting up a crypto wallet and acquiring USDC, which adds a learning curve. That said, Polymarket's wider variety of markets (sports, entertainment, crypto) may be more engaging for newer traders who want to trade events they already follow.</p>

          <summary class="faq-question">Can I trade on both platforms at the same time?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes. You can maintain active accounts on both Polymarket and Kalshi simultaneously. <a href="../architect.html">Mercury Architect</a> is built specifically for this — it connects to both platforms through a single interface, allowing you to monitor markets, execute trades, and run automated strategies across both exchanges without switching tools. This also enables cross-platform arbitrage when the same event has different prices on each platform.</p>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Which platform has more market variety?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Polymarket currently offers more total markets across a broader range of categories: politics, sports, crypto, entertainment, science, and pop culture. Kalshi has fewer total markets but offers unique contract types that Polymarket does not — particularly hourly weather contracts, daily economic indicator predictions, and rapid-expiry event contracts. If you want breadth, Polymarket leads. If you want unique, high-frequency contract types for systematic trading, Kalshi is unmatched.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary class="faq-question">Is Polymarket legal in the US?</summary>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Polymarket's US access has been restricted since a 2022 settlement with the CFTC. As of early 2026, US-based users face limitations on the platform. The regulatory landscape for prediction markets in the US continues to evolve, and Polymarket's status may change. Kalshi, by contrast, is fully CFTC-regulated and legally available to all eligible US residents. If you are based in the US and regulatory compliance is a priority, Kalshi is the clear choice. Always check the latest regulations and platform terms before depositing funds.</p>
